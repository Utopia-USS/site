  description: `
  We are a team of people joined by passion for technology and product creation.
  The company was founded in 2020 by four friends, colleagues and relatives - Mateusz, Jakub, Jakob and Thomas.
  We worked together in a number of initiatives including open-source and start-up projects as well as software development for customers.
  The decision to join our forces in our own organisation came from realizing that we share common values, interests and sense of humor.
  We love to create high quality, tidy, expandable software with an intuitive and charming user-layer and we love to experiment with new solutions.
  Please contact us for great product results and work experience for a reasonable price.
